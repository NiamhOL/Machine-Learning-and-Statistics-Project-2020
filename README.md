## Overview of Project

In this project focuses on creating a web service that uses machine learning to make predictions based on the data set powerproduction available on Moodle. The goal is to
produce a model that accurately predicts wind turbine power output from wind speed values, as in the data set. You must then develop a web service that will respond with
predicted power values based on speed values sent as HTTP requests. 

## Getting started
Download and install Python and Anaconda All files associated with this project are available at https://github.com/NiamhOL/Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project-2020

## Packages used in this project

The following packages were used to run statistical analysis and draw grpahs for this project.

* Python https://www.python.org/downloads/
* Anaconda https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/ - is the easiest way to perfrom Python data science machine learning on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.
* iPython https://ipython.org/ - it an interactive command-line terminal for Python.
* Numpy http://www.numpy.org/ - is the fundamental package for scientific computing within Python.
* Jupyter Notebook https://jupyter.org/ - is an open-source web application that allows the creation and sharing of documents that contains live code, equations, visualisations    and narriative text
